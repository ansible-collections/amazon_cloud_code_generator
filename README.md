# amazon_cloud_code_generator

`amazon_cloud_code_generator` generates the [``amazon.cloud collection``](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud) from the CloudFormation Resource Type Definition Schema or meta-schema.

## Requirements

The `amazon_cloud_code_generator` relies on the CloudFormation client. Hence, the following requirements must be met:
- `boto3 >= 1.20.0`
- `botocore >= 1.23.0`
- `Python 3.9`
- `tox`

## Usage

The `amazon_cloud_code_generator`'s core content is hosted in the `amazon_cloud_code_generator/` directory containing the following subdirectories:

- `cmd/` - hosts the main logic of the `amazon_cloud_code_generator`.
    ```
    │   ├── generator.py  # Implements the logic to scrape the  CloudFormation resource schema and performs all the pre-processing needed to produce each module's DOCUMENTATION block
    │   ├── refresh_examples.py  # Implements the logic to update EXAMPLES block scraping all the tasks tagged with `tags: [docs]` from `amazon_cloud_code_generator/data/tests/integration/targets/`
    │   ├── refresh_modules.py  # Implements the logic to generate all the modules specified inside `resources.py` including all the utilities
    │   ├── resources.py  # Sets the AWS resources names we are going to generate  
    │   ├── utils.py  # Implements utilities functions for the generator
    ```

- `config/` - Contains the `modules.yaml` file where for each of the AWS resources we are going to generate an entry representing the module's name must be added. Additionally, you can also set other information that is going to be used in module's DOCUMENTATION like short_description, description, and so forth.

- `data/` - Contains the content that will be copied over the generated collection. A high level overview of the subdirectory's content is shown below.
    ```
    ├── changelogs  # Changelog fragments that will be used for the new collection release
    │   ├── plugins
    │   │   └── module_utils # Modules utils that are used by the collection plugins
    │   │       ├── core.py
    │   │       ├── utils.py
    │   │       └── waiters.py
    │   └── tests  # Contains the units and integrations tests
    │       ├── config.yml
    │       ├── integration
    │       │   ├── constraints.txt
    │       │   ├── requirements.txt
    │       │   └── targets
    │       │       ├── logs
    │       │       │   ├── aliases
    │       │       │   └── tasks
    │       │       │       └── main.yml
    │       │       ├── ...
    │       └── unit
    │           ├── constraints.txt
    │           ├── module_utils
    │           │   ├── test_core.py
    │           │   └── test_utils.py
    │           └── requirements.txt
    ```

- `templates/` -  Host the templates files that will be used to generate each collection plugin. 
    ```
    ├── default_module.j2
    └── header.j2
    ```

The modules generated by the `amazon_cloud_code_generator/` will be made availabale in the `cloud` subdirectory by default. You can use the following command to do so:

```python -m amazon_cloud_code_generator.cmd.refresh_modules```

A different target directory can be specified by using:

```tox -e refresh_modules --target-dir /somewhere/else```

When available, the documented EXAMPLE block of the generated modules can be updated by using the following command:

```python -m amazon_cloud_code_generator.cmd.refresh_modules --target-dir /somewhere/else```

## How to refresh the amazon.cloud collection

Fork the original [``amazon.cloud collection``](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud) repository to your account on GitHub. Ensure to have the path `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/amazon/cloud` and clone the repository from your fork:
```
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/amazon/cloud
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/amazon.cloud ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/amazon/cloud
```

Refresh the content of the modules moving in the repository path using `tox -e refresh_modules`.
This command will refresh the content of the ``amazon.cloud collection`` plugins including EXAMPLE block and will format the plugins using the black formatter.
```
cd ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/amazon/cloud
tox -e refresh_modules
```

You can also specify the next release version by passing the `--next-version` parameter as follows:
```
tox -e refresh_modules --next-version 0.2.0
```

Individual opperations are also allowed. 

For example, you can only format the Python code of the plugins using the black formatter by running:

```tox -e black```

You can also refresh the plugins documentation localed in `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/amazon/cloud/docs` just by running.

```tox -e add_docs```

Run `ansible-test` to validate the generated content using:
```
virtualenv -p python3.9 ~/tmp/venv-tmp-py39-aws
source ~/tmp/venv-tmp-py39-aws/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r test-requirements.txt ansible
ansible-test sanity --requirements --local --python 3.9 -vvv
```

You can also execute all integration tests for the collection using:
```
ansible-test integration --requirements --docker

```
